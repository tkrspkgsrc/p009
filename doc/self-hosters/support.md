## Puter Support for a Particular Deployment

If you experience issues on a self-hosted deployment we're here to
help. Some issues are related to configuration or environment, so
we may only be able to help in a limited capacity. Issues related
to data loss, data corruption, or security will have higher priority
over other issues with particular deployments.
